Practice setting up web, database, and JPASpring using Springboot.
Setup Http methods in controller(Spring MVC), CRUD in service.

	1) let JPA know which classes are entities with Entity anotation (tables in relational database).
	2) interface repositories extend CRUDRepository interface with genetic types
	3) make service class to become persistentable (use framework-provided crud methods)
